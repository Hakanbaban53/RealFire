This script makes it easier to add box shadows and borders to tooltips without messing up some specific tooltips.

Some tooltips have an awkward structure, where multiple descriptions exist within a single container, with `display: -moz-popup`. This means the tooltip is displayed within a restricted popup area with dimensions equal to the container, and overflow completely hidden. Box shadows on the container therefore won't be visible, since they'll fall outside of the popup frame â€” you'd have to use a window shadow instead, but those can't be styled in a precise way.

In tooltips with only 1 label we can just make the container transparent and put the background and box shadow on the label element. That way there can still be room within the popup frame for the box shadow to be visible. A box shadow with a 5px radius can fit well within a container with ~7px padding. Tooltips with a more elaborate structure with containers within containers, e.g. the tab tooltip, don't have this problem at all. But tooltips like the back and forward buttons' can only be given a shadow if you give each label a background color, and try to position and size them so that they perfectly overlap and create the illusion of being one element.

But if you also want rounded corners and borders, that won't be an option. A good way to fix this is just to put the tooltips inside of another container, so that's what this script does. Because generic tooltips are native-anonymous, they don't inherit variables from the main window. So if you want to customize the theme's tooltips, you have to edit [userChrome.ag.css][] directly to change some things. If you want to disable the borders, 1) don't use this script, and 2) go to <about:config> and set `userChrome.css.remove-tooltip-borders` to true.
